This is the software, for the Arduino Oscilloscope - published 
in The MagPi No. 71 July 2018

Using an Arduino Nano (Uno, Mega or other 16MHz Arduinos will do) as a rapid voltage sample gatherer, and Python software for display and measurement. It will measure voltages between +/- 2.5V AC or  +/- 25V AC or with a standard oscilloscope X10 probe. With a 58KHz sample rate.
